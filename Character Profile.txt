Character Profiles:

Marvin:

- Male
- 20
- Uni student
- Has lived with (Maria) for a year and a half
- Sick of dealing with flatmate's shit
- Couldn't find a place to move out into, knows he has to live with (Maria)
again next year

Flatmate (Maria):

- Female
- 21
- Uni student, lives in the same flat as Marvin
- Self-centered (oblivious of what other people might want to say)
	- Always turns conversations to her, never asks about anyone else
	unless it is as a gateway to a story she wants to tell
- Leaves washing up in the sink, so no one else can do their washing up
- Leaves the hob and counter tops filthy; claims it's not their mess
- Always talking loudly at you, but never listens to answers

Scenario:

- Last night (Maria) left a huge mess in the kitchen. When asked to clean it up,
she got mad and refused to clean, claiming that it's not just her mess and that
other people need to clean their stuff first. Marvin didn't want to say anything
to her about it because he doesn't want to make more of a fuss (since she'd only
get madder), but he is sick of cleaning up after her, listening to her drone on
constantly about things he doesn't find interesting, and not being able to get a 
word in edgeways.
